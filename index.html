            <p>Most of the time when I'm talking to other technology professionals about LinkedIn, they get pissed off and go into some rant related to LinkedIn being primarily a communication channel for receiving recruiter spam so let's get this out of the way first. You're going to get spammed at least a little.  But...</p>

<p><ul class='style1'>
    <li> You can probably spot these kinds of messages from a mile away </li>
    <li>  You don't have to respond to these! </li>
    <li>  Are you the only person in the world that is not getting spam from every other direction already? </li>
    <li>  These tips will hopefully reduce the signal-to-noise ratio if you are already on LinkedIn </li>

<p>I think at some point before AJAX was the norm for consumer-facing web-apps, I probably thought on-demand loading was cool, too.  Now, it's usually a usability nightmare.  It's even worse if we're talking about responsive sites on mobile devices because they've got to serve a variety of clients on a variety of connection speeds.  Last night, while drinking a glass of wine and trying to do some on-line shopping on my phone, I ended up at multiple e-commerce websites that had implemented on-demand loading.  None of them nailed it.  Some were better than others.  The exact use case on all the sites was this:</p>

<ol class='style1'>
<li>User selects some category ("Men's Shirts" or "sale")</li>
<li>A list of the first N results is loaded, the user can scrolls vertically (e.g., 1 column, N rows) </li>
<li>When the user gets to the bottom of the results, either the page ajax-loads the next N number, or the user can click to initiate the loading of the next N results.</li>
</ol>

            <p>Earlier this week I spent some time playing with Redis on my local dev box.  Set-up was smooth sailing; install virtual box w/Ubuntu, Redis, set up port forwarding from a host port to a guest port, grab ServiceStack.Redis...I was on my way.  Things got a bit more interesting after I deployed Redis to Azure.  I changed the configuration in my little console test application to point to the Azure instance.  It was running on the default Redis port, 6379.  Fired up the console application...tried a SET.  Timed out.  Tried it again - same result.  </p>

        <p>
            <p>I came across this error today while moving some source around TFS.  I had moved a project from from TFS Project Collection to another, done a get latest and everything built just fine.  However, when trying to run unit tests after all the tests were discovered, I saw the "Exception has Been Thrown by the Target of an Invocation When Attempting to Run Unit Tests" error message in the Output window.  I figured I'd try doing a get latest and running the tests on my other machine.  That worked without issue.  That was the first big clue; this had to do with my VS, not the source that was checked in.  After trying pretty much everything in this <a href="http://hjerpbakk.com/blog/2011/5/30/exception-has-been-thrown-by-the-target-of-an-invocation.html" target="_blank">blog post</a>, I did a quick compare on VS versions; noticed the machine where everything was working had Visual Studio Update 3, the machine that was throwing this error did not.  I went ahead and installed that.  Great, that had to be it right? WRONG.  That just caused me to get a different error, even <em>more</em> nebulous error; "Executor Process Exited".  Clearly this was still environmental.  Turns out the answer was going into Test Settings and changing the default processor architecture to x64.  That is, Test > Test Settings > Default Processor Architecture > x64.  Cue unicorns and rainbows.</p>

            <p>Last week I attended the NYC Neo4j Meetup on Data Modeling &amp; Natural Language Search, even better, I happened to win tickets to GraphConnect NYC which was just a few days later.  I decided to compile some notes from the event, but rather than just bullet-pointing out the content, I decided to compile a brief synopsis of each of the forums I attended so you know which slides to review or video to check out first.  This should be a pretty decent place to start if you're just looking to get your bearings when it comes to Graph DBs and Neo4j.  There are also a bunch of videos available at <a href="http://watch.neo4j.org/" target="_blank">http://watch.neo4j.org/</a>.</p>

<p>Well...I finally got around to tweaking my blog, and in theory that will mean I actually get to writing a bit more.  This instance of my blog is running on <a href="https://github.com/Sandra/Sandra.Snow/" target="_blank">Sandra Snow</a>.  It's basically a port of <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll" target="_blank">Jekyll</a> with some additional features, and of course running on .NET (<a href="https://github.com/NancyFx/Nancy" target="_blank">NancyFx</a>) rather than Ruby.  The way both of these work is pretty much the same..</p>

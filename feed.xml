This instance of my blog is running on &lt;a href="https://github.com/Sandra/Sandra.Snow/" target="_blank"&gt;Sandra Snow&lt;/a&gt;.  It's basically a port of &lt;a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll" target="_blank"&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt; with some additional features, and of course running on .NET (&lt;a href="https://github.com/NancyFx/Nancy" target="_blank"&gt;NancyFx&lt;/a&gt;) rather than Ruby.  The way both of these work is pretty much the same..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Create a mark-down files --&gt; Run Sandra.Snow --&gt; Get HTML pages --&gt; Push to GitHub&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A mark-down file is really just a text file with some basic keywords (you can find more info on the specifics &lt;a href="https://github.com/Sandra/Sandra.Snow/wiki/Markdown-File-Header" target="_blank"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;).  Sandra.Snow basically reads these in, parses to appy the some rules (paging, etc.), and then spits out some pretty HTML which I push to GitHub (hello, entirely free hosting).  This all means that when you hit my blog, you are hitting purely static HTML; zero database calls (well, unless GitHub is doing some).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/philliphaydon" target="_blank"&gt;@PhillipHaydon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jchannon" target="_blank"&gt;@jchannon&lt;/a&gt; for their work on putting this together.  &lt;/p&gt;
